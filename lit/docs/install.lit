A Concourse installation is composed of a \reference{web-node}, a
\reference{worker-node}, and a \reference{postgresql-node}.

There are many ways to deploy Concourse, depending on your personal preference.
The \reference{quick-start} guide shows how to get Concourse up and running
quickly via Docker Compose, and there is also an official \link{Concourse Helm
chart}{https://github.com/concourse/concourse-chart}.

The documentation found here will primarily focus on the \code{concourse} CLI,
which is the lowest common denominator, and can also be directly used if you
want to just run Concourse yourself on real hardware or your own managed VMs.

The high-level steps to follow for installing Concourse are:

\ordered-list{
  Setup a Postgres database
}{
  Generate Secrets for the web and worker nodes
}{
  Install the web node
}{
  Install the worker node
}

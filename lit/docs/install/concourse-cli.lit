\use-plugin{concourse-docs}

The \code{concourse} CLI can be downloaded from the \link{latest GitHub
release}{https://github.com/concourse/concourse/releases/latest} - make sure to
grab the appropriate archive for your platform. Each \code{concourse-*} archive
contains the following files:

\codeblock{sh}{{
concourse/bin/concourse
concourse/bin/gdn            # Linux only
concourse/fly-assets/...
concourse/resource-types/... # Linux only
}}

The Linux release is the largest among all the platforms because it contains
some of the most commonly used resource types like the
\link{git}{https://github.com/concourse/git-resource},
\link{time}{https://github.com/concourse/time-resource/}, and
\link{registry-image}{https://github.com/concourse/registry-image-resource/}
resources. Resources only run on Linux workers, that's why the other platforms
are not bundled with resources; resources don't currently exist for non-linux
platforms.

When extracted, the \code{concourse} binary will auto-discover its sibling
assets based on its file location, so you may extract it anywhere. On Linux a
typical install location is \code{/usr/local/concourse}:

\codeblock{sh}{{
tar -zxf concourse-*.tgz -C /usr/local
}}

From there, you can either add \code{/usr/local/concourse/bin} to your
\code{$PATH}, or just execute \code{/usr/local/concourse/bin/concourse}
directly.

\inline-header{Configuring \code{concourse}}

All Concourse \code{web} and \code{worker} node configuration is defined
statically via flags. For a full list of flags, you can pass \code{--help} to
any command.

\titled-codeblock{CLI Commands}{bash}{{
concourse web --help
concourse worker --help
concourse quickstart --help
concourse migrate --help
concourse generate-key --help
concourse land-worker --help
concourse retire-worker --help
}}

Each flag can also be set via an environment variable. The env var for each
flag is based on the flag name uppercased, preceded with \code{CONCOURSE_} and
dashes (\code{-}) replaced with underscores (\code{_}). These are also shown in
\code{--help}.

Various sections in documentation may refer to configuration via env vars
rather than flags, but they are both equivalent and interchangeable. Env
vars are simply easier to reference in isolation and are more useful to
copy-paste.
